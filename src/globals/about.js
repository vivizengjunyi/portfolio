Also, I am a graduate of the Front-end Web Developer Program at BCIT â€” a full-time six-month program with hands-on experience building inventive websites from scratch. Before this program, I attended two part-time web development courses at ComIT and Emily Carr from January to April in 2021. When flowing back to 2020, I started self-studying web development through MDN, freeCodeCamp, and W3School. Roughly calculating, I have been on the technical journey for more than 2 years. ',
